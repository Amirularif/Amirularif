### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Amirul Arif, a full-stack Mobile and Web Developer, and creative coder with huge regard to details who specializes in front-end and back-end development. I make it my mission to translate beautiful user-interface and user-focused designs into fully functional Web/Mobile applications.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning
